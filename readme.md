Server.js file

node is saying we want to handle http traffic, this traffic requires a request response. 

utilize these systems response.writeHead(200)--put in the headers a response code of 200


through the package control.json we link the node to connect to the server.js platform

Fs- gives node the access to view files off your computer

http object is the same as require http

This calls a request and serves a response.


server.listen= server has a listen method, traffic comes in on port 8000.. what ever we put inside this server listen 

every single time someone hits the server there will be a new request and new response

url is everything after
